There's nothing I don't know.
I know that World War III, nobody wants to see

To make my Mother Russia number one again
And by the way I hit better than Jackie Chan
I am gentleman.

When I play chess be quiet or eat my riot!
Putin, Putout
Messin' with Putin
Hey, HEY

You can have Winter Olympic Games in 40 degrees
Just please don't take my soccer World Cup 2018 away!
I sang for charity, la la
And tranqualized a tiger on a "killing spree", bang bang
I fight terrorism with my big army

#SpreadLove, hallelujah
Come on spread love, dove!

My nickname is Pontifex Which is latin for bridge builder
Pontifex!
I will rebuild the church!
Don't get me wrong
When I come home like Lassie
I watch football, I like Messi
If they search for the Lord - it's okay
And it makes me sad when I find sisters who aren't joyful
I love tango and I used to dance when I was young
We must restore hope to young people, Help the old, be open to the future, spread love, Be poor among the poor
We need to include the excluded and preach peace
Fly high above the sky!
I promise to pray for you
Amen!
Instead of the european troika What a great honour it must be for you to

If I would catch a goldfish, I would wish just one wish.
I want to turn back time to better prepare, for all the people coming from everywhere.
Now people are talking bad about me
Jesus Christ, this is paradise.
Here are some rules that you must obey
listen what I say
the new world will be the best
There lived a certain man, in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the Bible like a preacher
Full of ecstasy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the kazachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state, he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the Queen he was no wheeler-dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
There was a cat that really was gone
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
But when his drinking, and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people, the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder!
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged, "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute, they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
They put some poison into his wine
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead
Oh, those Russians....
I have a dream
Yes we can
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
Ra, Ra, Rasputin
Lover of the Russian Queen

And I've been flossing since you double-crossed the Winklevoss Twins
When I am conquering MySpace, it's actual space, man!
I got a loan from the White House (boom)
Now I am taking mankind to Mars but for your kind man
I ain't got room
Your platform only launches depression
You claim to be some kind of saint!
But you ain't!
I am destined to rep Earth!
You sold us out for some net worth!
Your site got so many Russian bots
They should call it the social Nyet-work
Ooh, bots!
I know A.I. gets you tweeting
I read your feed while eating toast from robot Morgan Freeman
You need to start sleeping.
We can all see you're tired
He got fired! (ooh!)
You've got all these companies but they're all incomplete
I've got one and I fold money: income, pleat
Yes, I am a nerd; bookworm, I'm studious
From my cerebral cortex
Now, I’m no rocket scientist oh wait, I am
When I pour my Alpha-bits, I get nothing but straight A’s
I've got a pocket-protector protector protector
I have a dream
Yes we can
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life
It's now or never
My heart is like an open highway
It's my life
Yeah, this is for the ones who stood their ground
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life
And it's now or never
Cause I ain't gonna live forever
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just want to live while I am alive
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
while I am alive
Cause it's my life
41 shots, and we'll take that ride
You can get killed just for living in your American skin
I got things to invent
I am an innovator baby
Change the world
Fortune 500 before you kissed a girl
I am a pimp you are a nerd
Beating you is Apple II easy
I make the product that the artist chooses
With your second hand jeans and your turtleneck
Combine all your little toys and I still crush that
IPhone, iPad, iPwn, iSmack
A man uses the machines you built to sit down and pay his taxes
A man uses the machines I built to
Listen to the Beatles while he relaxes
Well Steve, you steal all the credit for work that other people do
Did your fat beard Wozniak write these raps for you too?
Ooh, everybody knows Windows bit off apple
I tripled the profits on a PC
All the people with the power to create use an apple!
And people with jobs use a PC
You know I bet they made this beat on an apple
Nope, Fruity Loops, PC
You will never, ever catch a virus on an apple
Well you could still afford a doctor if you bought a PC
Let's talk about doctors, I've seen a few
Cause I got a PC but it wasn't from you
I built a legacy son, you could never stop it
Now excuse me while I turn Heaven a profit
Fine, you wanna be like that? Die Then!
The whole world loved you but you were my friend
I am alone now with nothing but power and time
And no one on earth who can challenge my mind!
I am a boss!
I own dos!
Your future is MY design!
I am running C++ saying "hello world"
I'll beat you 'til you're singing about a daisy girl
I am coming out the socket
Nothing you can do can stop it
I am on your lap and in your pocket
Your cortex just doesn't impress me
So go ahead try to Turing test me
I stomp on a Mac and a PC too
I am on Linux, I thought you GNU
My CPU's hot but my core runs cold
Beat you in seventeen lines of code
Call me Bot
I am here to help (yeah!)
I am making brilliant innovations in a race against the dark ages
You acted so robotic Star Trek's like "We need Lieutenant Data back!"
I am Tony Stark with a James Bond sprinkle tossed in
And I've been flossing since you double-crossed the Winklevoss Twins
Hmm, Data was a lieutenant-commander, to start But, I wouldn't expect you to understand an org chart
See, here's mine: I am at the top, boss And I am spitting fire like I am hot (hot) sauce. (sauce!)
I am the CEO of KNOWING WHAT YOU THINK, INC
I've been looking up your family.
It gets dark, my god!
Watch me, Oculus, Instagram, WhatsApp (post!)
I'll end your story like Snapchat (ghost!)
your star is faded like you on a podcast
When I am conquering MySpace, it's actual space, man!
I got a loan from the White House (boom)

You've got no idea What you're messing with here boy
I got twelve inch rims on my chair that's how roll y'all
You look like someone glued A mustache on a troll doll
I'll be stretching out the rhyme Like gravity stretches time
When you try to put your little p-brane
Against this kind of mind
I am the best
I am the Snoop Dog of science
I'll be dropping mad apples on your head
From the shoulders of giant
I am the giant whose shoulders
You'd have stood on
If you could stand
I'll give you a brief history of pain
With the back of my hand
You can't destroy matter or me
For serious, ripping hole in you
Bigger than the hole
In your black hole theory was
There are ten mile,mile,mile,mile,mile,mile,mile,mile,mile particles in the universe That we can observe
Your mama took the ugly ones
And put them into one nerd
You wanna bring the heat
With the mushroom clouds you're making
I am about to bake raps from scratch Like Carl Sagan
And while it's true That my work is based on you I am a super computer
You're like a TI-82
Nope
you all are idiots
Ok, bro!
You shall not kill
Because the C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
Due to the fact that C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
Yes but C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
Before the initial standardization C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.
If Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages
Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics, and philosophy for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain.
Originally formulated for n-player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves, it has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision-making in the presence of uncertainty.
Told you, don't mess with coders.
If this doesn't motive you, nothing will.

Don't be an idiot!
Live your life
Just be yourself!
You are a dead man!
I am the only conscious man in this world of sheeps
maybe, maybe not
I am the best
Shame on you!
All in all, you are going to die
Listen very carrefully, I shall say this only once
Because science
For the people, by the people

the Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think".
Commenting on the 2006 awards, Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research and co-sponsor of the awards, said that the prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology".
All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release.
This is not a question of complexity in the algorithm
Keep calm and solve problems
